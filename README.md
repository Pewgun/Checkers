# Checkers

There is only one python file in this repositry and that is the file where all the logic and gameplay of checkers is stored.

You might be familiar with rules but i am going to list them anyway:
1. jump must be taken if it is available
2. a man can jump forward and backward
3. multijumps are obligatory
4. kings can move to any square and after a jump if another jump might be available it has to be taken
